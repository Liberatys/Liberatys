### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently an intern working at @Renuo.
We develop applications with Ruby on Rails, Elixir and Js-Frameworks.

I'm interested in databases, the web, text editors and everything that is connected to vim or neovim.

At the moment I'm trying to implement my own text editor :D **VOLT**


Have a great day
